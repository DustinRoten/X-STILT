# X-STILT: Column-Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport model
## Descriptions:
Scripts and subroutines for X-STILT, modified from the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model [*Lin et al*., 2003] and STILT-R version 2 [*Fasoli et al*., 2018]. Methodology is based on [*Wu et al*., 2018] (in review on *Geoscientific Model Development Discussion*). Detailed descriptions can be found in each directory (*archive_v1.1* and *lastest_v2.0*).

Developments are still ongoing towards a more flexible model framework that can be more easily applied to other column measurements. Contributions from other users are welcomed and highly appreciated. Please contact Dien (Dien.Wu@utah.edu) if you have any questions/comments/suggestions.
